# The Cow-Coyote Relationship: A Prey-Predator Ecosystem

## Behavior of the Agents


## Adjustable Parameters
To fully understand how each of the components affect the system as a whole, the model has six (6) configurable parameters:
1. `num-preys` → the initial number of cows in the model
2. `num-predators` → the initial number of coyotes in the model
3. `food-growth-time` → dictates the time (in seconds) it takes for an eaten grass patch to grow 
4. `fixed-energy` → the initial energy all cows and coyotes have in the model
5. `fixed-coyote-reproducing` → the probability that a coyote will reproduce
6. `fixed-cow-reproducing` → the probability that a cow will reproduce

## Things to Observe
In the model, there are some things that we can observe:
1. the **population of the cows**, which can be seen in the `Number of Cows` monitor;
2. the **population of the coyotes**, through the `Number of Coyotes` monitor;
3. the **number of available grass patches**, using the `Number of Food (Grass)` monitor;
4. the **number of cows that died by being eaten by coyotes**, via the `Cows eaten by Coyote` monitor; and
5. the **number of cows that died by lost of energy**, through the `Cows died due to no Energy` monitor.

## How to run the model locally
1. Extract the folder from the zipped file that you can download through this DownGit [link](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/francheska-vicente/prey-predator-model).
2. Once you open the folder, you can double-click the `prey-predator-model.nlogo` file to launch the model on NetLogo.
